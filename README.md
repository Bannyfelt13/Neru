# Neru

> Now sleeping...

**WIP**: This project is under inactive development, you can take a part in contributing by.

## Important

It does not have support for a game company's custom type, and will automatically return data as-is when it encounters a field containing a custom type, which I will support in the future.

And the code is messy üò≠

## Name

A product of sleep deprivation, from the Japanese „ÄåÂØù„Çã„Äç.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
# Before start, you need to edit config.json
node app.js [pcap]
```

## Thanks
